# Cloudinary Setup Guide

## What We've Added

Your project now includes cloud storage integration using Cloudinary! Here's what changed:

1. **Cloudinary Configuration** (`cloudinary-config.js`)
2. **Updated Multer Config** (`multer-config.js`) - Now uses cloud storage instead of local files
3. **Enhanced File Routes** - Files are uploaded to Cloudinary and URLs are stored in the database
4. **Error Handling** - Added proper error views for the share functionality

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Cloudinary Account
- Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
- Sign up for a free account
- Get your credentials from the dashboard

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database_name"

# Session
SESSION_SECRET="your-super-secret-session-key-here"

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"

# Server
PORT=3000
```

### 3. Update Your Database
Run the following commands to ensure your database is up to date:

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
```

### 4. Test the Integration
- Start your server: `npm run dev`
- Try uploading a file - it should now go to Cloudinary
- Check the file details page - you should see the Cloudinary URL

## How It Works Now

1. **File Upload**: Files are uploaded directly to Cloudinary
2. **URL Storage**: Cloudinary URLs are stored in the `url` field of your File model
3. **File Download**: Downloads now redirect to Cloudinary URLs
4. **File Management**: Files are automatically managed by Cloudinary
